# replicator-quiz-demo

1. Environment Setup:
   - Install the latest version of Android Studio from the official website.
   - Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

2. Clone the Repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-app-couchbase-lite.git
   cd quiz-app-couchbase-lite
   ```

3. Open the Project:
   - Launch Android Studio.
   - Select "Open an Existing Project" and navigate to the cloned repository.

4. Configure Gradle:
   - Once the project is opened, Android Studio will automatically sync the Gradle files.
   - If prompted, update to the latest Gradle version.

5. Check Dependencies:
   - Open the `app/build.gradle` file.
   - Ensure the following dependencies are included:
     ```gradle
     dependencies {
         implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:$kotlin_version"
         implementation "androidx.core:core-ktx:$core_ktx_version"
         implementation "androidx.appcompat:appcompat:$appcompat_version"
         implementation "com.couchbase.lite:couchbase-lite-android:$couchbase_lite_version"
         // Add other necessary dependencies
     }
     ```

6. Set Up Couchbase Lite:
   - In the `DatabaseManager.kt` file, ensure the database initialization is correct.
   - Check that the database name and collection names are properly set.
   - Ensure you setup App Services setup in Capella. After getting the connection string and the user created in App Services fill out the following in `DatabaseManager.kt` file:
    - In line 114
     ```
         url = URI(
            "urlAddress" \\ Add the connection string URL Address here 
        )
     ```
    - In line 133
      ```
         config.setAuthenticator(BasicAuthenticator("username", "password".toCharArray())) // Replace the username and password with the user details you havr created
      ```

7. Prepare the Questions:
   - Verify that the `questions.json` file in the `assets` folder contains the quiz questions.
   - Make sure the JSON structure matches the expected format in the app.

8. Configure the Android Emulator:
   - In Android Studio, go to Tools > AVD Manager.
   - Create a new virtual device or use an existing one (preferably with API level 29 or higher).

9. Build the Project:
   - Click on Build > Make Project to compile the code.
   - Resolve any build errors that may occur.

10. Run the Application:
    - Before running the Android application, run the Python server separately.
    - Open another terminal window, and navigate to the python-server directory
    ```
    cd python-server
    ```
    - The requirements.txt file in the python-server directory lists the necessary dependencies. Install them using pip:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    - The ```app.py``` file has the logic for the AlexNet model to generate embeddings for an image passed by the Kotlin app. Now run the app. 
    ```
    python app.py
    ```

    Note: The AlexNet model only produces images of embedding size of 3 or 9 which might not be very accurate, instead you can use the CLIP model which produces image embeddings of 512 dimensions, if you wish to try out CLIP Model implementation, you can refer to the [Clip Model](https://github.com/shivay-couchbase/quiz-demo-replicator/tree/clip_Model) branch and instead of running `python app.py` you can run `python app1.py`.
    
    - Now let's head back to our Android app
    - Select the emulator or connect a physical Android device.
    - Click on the "Run" button (green play icon) in Android Studio.
    - Wait for the app to install and launch on the device.

12. Using the App:
    - When the app launches, you'll see the main screen.
    - Enter your username when prompted.
    - The app will likely ask for camera permissions for image recognition.
    - Take a photo or select an image to determine the quiz category.
    - Answer the quiz questions as they appear.
    - After completing the quiz, view your score and check the leaderboard.

13. Debugging:
    - If you encounter any issues, check the Logcat in Android Studio for error messages.
    - Pay attention to any Couchbase-related logs for database operations.

14. Testing Synchronization (if implemented):
    - If the app includes synchronization features, ensure you have the Capella App Services properly setup.
    - Configure the replication URL in the app's settings or `DatabaseManager.kt`.
    - Test synchronization by running the app on multiple devices or emulators.

15. Customization:
    - To modify questions, edit the `questions.json` file.
    - To change the UI, look for XML layout files in the `res/layout` directory.
    - To adjust app behavior, modify the Kotlin files in the `app/src/main/java/com/example/quizappbycouchbase/` directory.

Remember to handle any required permissions, such as internet access or file system access, in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Also, ensure that you're complying with any licensing requirements for Couchbase Lite and other libraries used in the project.
